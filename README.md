# Introduction

This is a test project for me where I try to learn some more Scala, while at the same time developing something that can be used. It is basically a blog. At a later point it might be seperated into mini services.

#### Selenium
To run some of the unit tests, selenium is required. You are required to install the chromedriver for selenium. On a mac you can do this through 

    brew install chromedriver

It might be that your chromedriver isn't compatible with your chrome version. In that case you can manually find a chrome driver here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/.
When you are manually downloading a chromedriver you must ensure that it is available in the path.
